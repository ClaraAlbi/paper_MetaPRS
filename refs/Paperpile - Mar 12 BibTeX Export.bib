              Swaminathan, R and Thakker, R V and Spector, T D",
  abstract = "A classical twin study was performed to assess the relative
              contribution of genetic and environmental factors to bone
              metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and the hormones regulating
              them. It was examined further whether the genetic effect is
              menopause dependent. The subjects were 2136 adult twins (98.3\%
              female): 384 monozygotic (MZ) and 684 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.
              The intraclass correlations were calculated, and maximum
              likelihood model fitting was used to estimate genetic and
              environmental variance components. The intraclass correlations
              for all of the variables assessed were higher in MZ twin pairs.
              The heritabilities (95\% CIs) obtained from model fitting for
              hormones regulating bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis were
              parathyroid hormone (PTH), 60\% (54-65\%); 25-hydroxyvitamin D
              [25(OH)D]; 43\% (28-57\%), 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)], 65\%
              (53-74\%); and vitamin D binding protein 62\% (56-66\%). The
              heritabilities (95\% CIs) for markers of bone formation also were
              assessed; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), 74\%
              (67-80\%), and osteocalcin, 29\% (14-44\%); marker of bone
              resorption deoxypyridinoline (DPD), 58\% (52-64\%); and measure
              of calcium homeostasis 24 h urine calcium, creatinine (Cr), 52\%
              (41-61\%). The magnitude of genetic influence differed with
              menopause for most variables. This study provides evidence for
              the importance of genetic factors in determining bone resorption
              and formation, calcium excretion, and the hormones regulating
              these processes. It shows for the first time a clear genetic
              effect on bone resorption in premenopausal women and the
              regulation of PTH, vitamin D metabolism, and calcium excretion.
              The genes controlling bone hormones and markers are likely to be
              useful therapeutic and diagnostic targets.",

              as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing
              genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data
              sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the
              new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these
              issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set.
              With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of
              markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly
              manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing
              tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient,
              PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data
              that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK
              and describe the five main domains of function: data management,
              summary statistics, population stratification, association
              analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we
              focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and
              identity-by-descent information in the context of
              population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be
              used to detect and correct for population stratification and to
              identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical
              by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis
              of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map
              disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a
              population-based linkage analysis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) has substantial
              heritability and a polygenic architecture. However, the potential
              of genomic risk scores to help predict CAD outcomes has not been
              evaluated comprehensively, because available studies have
              involved limited genomic scope and limited sample sizes.
              OBJECTIVES: This study sought to construct a genomic risk score
              for CAD and to estimate its potential as a screening tool for
              primary prevention. METHODS: Using a meta-analytic approach to
              combine large-scale, genome-wide, and targeted genetic
              association data, we developed a new genomic risk score for CAD
              (metaGRS) consisting of 1.7 million genetic variants. We
              externally tested metaGRS, both by itself and in combination with
              available data on conventional risk factors, in 22,242 CAD cases
              and 460,387 noncases from the UK Biobank. RESULTS: The hazard
              ratio (HR) for CAD was 1.71 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68
              to 1.73) per SD increase in metaGRS, an association larger than
              any other externally tested genetic risk score previously
              published. The metaGRS stratified individuals into significantly
              different life course trajectories of CAD risk, with those in the
              top 20\% of metaGRS distribution having an HR of 4.17 (95\% CI:
              3.97 to 4.38) compared with those in the bottom 20\%. The
              corresponding HR was 2.83 (95\% CI: 2.61 to 3.07) among
              individuals on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications.
              The metaGRS had a higher C-index (C = 0.623; 95\% CI: 0.615 to
              0.631) for incident CAD than any of 6 conventional factors
              (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, self-reported
              high cholesterol, and family history). For men in the top 20\% of
              metaGRS with >2 conventional factors, 10\% cumulative risk of CAD
              was reached by 48 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic score
              developed and evaluated here substantially advances the concept
              of using genomic information to stratify individuals with
              different trajectories of CAD risk and highlights the potential
              for genomic screening in early life to complement conventional
              risk prediction.",

               biological and clinical research have been hindered by several

               present the PGS Catalog (www.PGSCatalog.org), an open resource

               Each PGS is annotated with metadata required for reproducibility
               as well as accurate application in independent studies. Using
               the PGS Catalog, we demonstrate that multiple PGS can be

              genome-wide association data from 26,676 T2D case and 132,532
              control subjects of European ancestry after imputation using the
              1000 Genomes multiethnic reference panel. Promising association
              signals were followed up in additional data sets (of 14,545 or
              7,397 T2D case and 38,994 or 71,604 control subjects). We
              identified 13 novel T2D-associated loci (P < 5 $\times$ 10-8),
              including variants near the GLP2R, GIP, and HLA-DQA1 genes. Our
              analysis brought the total number of independent T2D associations
              to 128 distinct signals at 113 loci. Despite substantially
              increased sample size and more complete coverage of low-frequency
              variation, all novel associations were driven by common single
              nucleotide variants. Credible sets of potentially causal variants
              were generally larger than those based on imputation with earlier
              reference panels, consistent with resolution of causal signals to
              common risk haplotypes. Stratification of T2D-associated loci
              based on T2D-related quantitative trait associations revealed
              tissue-specific enrichment of regulatory annotations in
              pancreatic islet enhancers for loci influencing insulin secretion
              and in adipocytes, monocytes, and hepatocytes for insulin
              action-associated loci. These findings highlight the predominant
              role played by common variants of modest effect and the diversity
              of biological mechanisms influencing T2D pathophysiology.",

  abstract = "Genomic selection refers to the use of dense markers covering the
              whole genome to estimate the breeding value of selection
              candidates for a quantitative trait. This paper considers
              prediction of breeding value based on a linear combination of the
              markers. In this case the best estimate of each marker's effect
              is the expectation of the effect conditional on the data. To
              calculate this requires a prior distribution of marker effects.
              If the marker effects are normally distributed with constant
              variance, BLUP can be used to calculate the estimated effects of
              the markers and hence the estimated breeding value (EBV). In this
              case the model is equivalent to a conventional animal model in
              which the relationship matrix among the animals is estimated from
              the markers instead of the pedigree. The accuracy of the EBV can
              approach 1.0 but a very large amount of data is required. An
              alternative model was investigated in which only some markers
              have non-zero effects and these effects follow a reflected
              exponential distribution. In this case the expected effect of a
              marker is a non-linear function of the data such that apparently
              small effects are regressed back almost to zero and consequently
              these markers can be deleted from the model. The accuracy in this
              case is considerably higher than when marker effects are normally
              distributed. If genomic selection is practiced for several
              generations the response declines in a manner that can be
              predicted from the marker allele frequencies. Genomic selection
              is likely to lead to a more rapid decline in the selection
              response than phenotypic selection unless new markers are
              continually added to the prediction of breeding value. A method
              to find the optimum index to maximise long term selection
              response is derived. This index varies the weight given to a
              marker according to its frequency such that markers where the
              favourable allele has low frequency receive more weight in the
              index.",

              have dramatically increased in size over the past few years, with
              modern datasets commonly including millions of variants measured
              in dozens of thousands of individuals. This increase in data size
              is a major challenge severely slowing down genomic analyses,
              leading to some software becoming obsolete and researchers having
              limited access to diverse analysis tools. Results: Here we
              present two R packages, bigstatsr and bigsnpr, allowing for the
              analysis of large scale genomic data to be performed within R. To
              address large data size, the packages use memory-mapping for
              accessing data matrices stored on disk instead of in RAM. To
              perform data pre-processing and data analysis, the packages
              integrate most of the tools that are commonly used, either
              through transparent system calls to existing software, or through
              updated or improved implementation of existing methods. In
              particular, the packages implement fast and accurate computations
              of principal component analysis and association studies,
              functions to remove single nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage
              disequilibrium and algorithms to learn polygenic risk scores on
              millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms. We illustrate
              applications of the two R packages by analyzing a case-control
              genomic dataset for celiac disease, performing an association
              study and computing polygenic risk scores. Finally, we
              demonstrate the scalability of the R packages by analyzing a
              simulated genome-wide dataset including 500 000 individuals and 1
              million markers on a single desktop computer. Availability and

              for the calculation, application and evaluation of polygenic risk
              scores (PRS). PRSice has been widely used in the field of
              psychiatric genetics since. Here we describe an updated version
              -- PRSice 2 -- which contains several important new features.
              While a key feature of the original version was its
              identification of the most predictive PRS via its `high
              resolution scoring', the inherent over-fitting involved meant
              that we recommended using a significance threshold of P < 0.001
              for testing based on permutation. PRSice 2 deals with this
              problem more directly by performing permutations on user data and
              thus estimating both empirical P-values and empirical R2 values.
              This is made feasible by the speed-up in PRSice 2 via its C++
              implementation - the algorithmic improvements in PRSice 2 lead to
              more than 30 times improvement in speed. Other new features
              include support for the binary oxford BGEN file format and a
              correction of the estimated R2 of model fit according to the
              ascertainment in the selection of cases (i.e. whether mild or
              severe cases). Methods We demonstrate the performance of PRSice 2
              here with our latest cross-trait PRS analysis results, and, in
              particular, investigate how confounding typically associated with
              non-genetic studies can be re-introduced in such studies and give

              require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and

              requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and
              increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal
              genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker
              effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in

              pedigree-based methods. With the use of this approach, it has
              been estimated that over half the heritability of human height
              can be attributed to the ~300,000 SNPs on a genome-wide
              genotyping array. In comparison, only 5\%-10\% can be explained
              by SNPs reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via
              simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning
              the mixed-model analysis used in SNP-based h(2) estimation.
              Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to
              violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to
              uneven linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs: contributions to
              h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high LD
              and are underestimated in regions of low LD. The overall
              direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic
              architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic
              scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which SNPs are
              weighted according to local LD. We show that this correction
              greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2)

              seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control
              Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate
              for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high LD in
              the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some
              nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we
              developed LDAK, software for computing LD-adjusted kinships.",

              the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have
              also developed an extension to the data format which adds
              low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase,
              multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which
              is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0).
              CONCLUSIONS: The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer
              dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the
              first time, users without access to high-end computing resources
              can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and
              very large genetic datasets coming into use.",

              examine important environmental or sociodemographic factors
              influencing 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and estimate its
              heritability. DESIGN: A sample of 226 male and female adolescent
              twins aged 13-20 yr from a large prospective twin cohort of rural
              Chinese children and adolescents that has been followed for 6 yr
              were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Blood level of 25(OH)D
              was measured using tandem mass spectrometry methodology. RESULTS:
              The overall mean (SD) 25(OH)D level was 18.0 (9.4) ng/ml, with
              wide variation by gender and season. In males (47.4\% of
              subjects), the mean (SD) 25(OH)D level was 12.1 (4.2) ng/ml in
              non-summer and 27.4 (8.8) ng/ml in summer; in females, it was
              10.1 (4.1) ng/ml in non-summer and 19.5 (6.3) ng/ml in summer. A
              multivariate model that included gender, age, season, physical
              activity, and student status demonstrated that male gender,
              summer season, and high physical activity significantly increased
              25(OH)D levels. Summer season and male gender also significantly
              decreased the risk of being in the lowest 25(OH)D tertile.
              Overall, 68.9\% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was
              attributable to additive genetic influence. Stratification by
              gender found that in males, 85.9\% of the variability in 25(OH)D
              level was attributable to such influence, but in females, it was
              only 17\%. CONCLUSION: In this sample of rural Chinese
              adolescents, 25(OH)D level was influenced by gender, season, and
              physical activity level. There was a strong genetic influence on
              25(OH)D level in males only.",

              It is not clear to what extent genetic influences play a role in
              determining vitamin D status. Thus far, studies on the
              heritability of vitamin D have provided conflicting results.
              OBJECTIVE: We estimated the heritability of vitamin D
              concentrations and the effect of season on heritability
              estimates. DESIGN: We measured serum 25(OH)D concentrations in
              510 middle-aged, male twins (310 monozygotic and 200 dizygotic
              twins) selected from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Generalized
              estimating equations were used to test the association between
              25(OH)D and other study factors. Structural equation modeling was
              used to estimate the heritability of 25(OH)D. RESULTS: The twins'
              mean ($\pm$SD) age was 55 $\pm$ 2.8 y. The mean ($\pm$SD) 25(OH)D
              concentration was 38.4 $\pm$ 23.3 ng/mL with a substantial
              seasonal variation (a 6.1-ng/mL lower value during the winter
              than during the summer, P = 0.003). Approximately 70\% of the
              variation in 25(OH)D concentrations during the winter was
              explained by genetic factors. However, in the summer, 25(OH)D
              concentrations were not heritable. During the summer, 53\% of the
              variation in 25(OH)D concentrations was due to shared
              environmental factors, and 47\% of the variation in 25(OH)D
              concentrations was due to unique environmental factors.
              CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations are highly heritable
              during the winter season only. In the summer, environmental
              conditions (eg, sun exposure) prevail over genetic backgrounds in

              published a review suggesting a beneficial role for vitamin D in
              cancer development. In the same year, a Cochrane meta-analysis
              that included 18 randomized clinical trials comparing vitamin D
              administration versus no intervention in healthy population found
              no difference regarding cancer incidence between the groups. One
              year later, a phase III trial published in the New England
              Journal of Medicine did not show any protective effect of vitamin
              D against adenoma development.Summary Vitamin D is well known for
              its importance in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, being
              essential for bone mineralization. However, calcitriol, or
              1,25-dyhydroxy-vitamin D3, is a multifunctional steroid hormone
              with many extra skeletal actions and may regulate signaling
              pathways related to cancer development and progression. In
              preclinical studies, it was shown that vitamin D can promote cell
              differentiation and inhibit proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell
              migration. Inconsistent results are found in epidemiological
              studies and early trials regarding clinical effects of vitamin D

              circulating levels of vitamin D and outcome of many common
              diseases, including endocrine diseases, chronic diseases, cancer
              progression, and autoimmune diseases. In particular, cells of the
              immune system (B cells, T cells, and antigen presenting cells),
              due to the expression of 1$\alpha$-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), are
              able to synthesize the active metabolite of vitamin D, which
              shows immunomodulatory properties. Moreover, the expression of
              the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in these cells suggests a local
              action of vitamin D in the immune response. These findings are
              supported by the correlation between the polymorphisms of the VDR

  abstract = "The objective of this study was to quantify the accuracy of
              imputing the genotype of parents using information on the
              genotype of their progeny and a family-based and population-based
              imputation algorithm. Two separate data sets were used, one
              containing both dairy and beef animals (n=3122) with high-density
              genotypes (735 151 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and
              the other containing just dairy animals (n=5489) with
              medium-density genotypes (51 602 SNPs). Imputation accuracy of
              three different genotype density panels were evaluated
              representing low (i.e. 6501 SNPs), medium and high density. The
              full genotypes of sires with genotyped half-sib progeny were
              masked and subsequently imputed. Genotyped half-sib progeny group
              sizes were altered from 4 up to 12 and the impact on imputation
              accuracy was quantified. Up to 157 and 258 sires were used to
              test the accuracy of imputation in the dairy plus beef data set
              and the dairy-only data set, respectively. The efficiency and
              accuracy of imputation was quantified as the proportion of
              genotypes that could not be imputed, and as both the genotype
              concordance rate and allele concordance rate. The median
              proportion of genotypes per animal that could not be imputed in
              the imputation process decreased as the number of genotyped
              half-sib progeny increased; values for the medium-density panel
              ranged from a median of 0.015 with a half-sib progeny group size
              of 4 to a median of 0.0014 to 0.0015 with a half-sib progeny
              group size of 8. The accuracy of imputation across different
              paternal half-sib progeny group sizes was similar in both data
              sets. Concordance rates increased considerably as the number of
              genotyped half-sib progeny increased from four (mean animal
              allele concordance rate of 0.94 in both data sets for the
              medium-density genotype panel) to five (mean animal allele
              concordance rate of 0.96 in both data sets for the medium-density
              genotype panel) after which it was relatively stable up to a
              half-sib progeny group size of eight. In the data set with
              dairy-only animals, sufficient sires with paternal half-sib
              progeny groups up to 12 were available and the within-animal mean
              genotype concordance rates continued to increase up to this group
              size. The accuracy of imputation was worst for the low-density
              genotypes, especially with smaller half-sib progeny group sizes
              but the difference in imputation accuracy between density panels
              diminished as progeny group size increased; the difference
              between high and medium-density genotype panels was relatively
              small across all half-sib progeny group sizes. Where biological
              material or genotypes are not available on individual animals, at
              least five progeny can be genotyped (on either a medium or
              high-density genotyping platform) and the parental alleles
              imputed with, on average, ⩾96\% accuracy.",

               (iPSYCH2012) aimed at unravelling the genetic and environmental
               architecture of severe mental disorders. The iPSYCH2012 sample
               is nested within the entire Danish population born between 1981
               and 2005, including 1 472 762 persons. This paper introduces the
               iPSYCH2012 sample and outlines key future research directions.
               Cases were identified as persons with schizophrenia (N=3540),
               autism (N=16 146), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
               (N=18 726) and affective disorder (N=26 380), of which 1928 had
               bipolar affective disorder. Controls were randomly sampled
               individuals (N=30 000). Within the sample of 86 189 individuals,
               a total of 57 377 individuals had at least one major mental
               disorder. DNA was extracted from the neonatal dried blood spot
               samples obtained from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank and
               genotyped using the Illumina PsychChip. Genotyping was
               successful for 90\% of the sample. The assessments of exome
               sequencing, methylation profiling, metabolome profiling,
               vitamin-D, inflammatory and neurotrophic factors are in
               progress. For each individual, the iPSYCH2012 sample also
               includes longitudinal information on health, prescribed
               medicine, social and socioeconomic information, and analogous
               information among relatives. To the best of our knowledge, the

  title    = "Efficient Implementation of Penalized Regression for Genetic Risk
              Prediction",
  author   = "Priv{\'e}, Florian and Aschard, Hugues and Blum, Michael G B",
  abstract = "Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) combine genotype information across
              many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to give a score
              reflecting the genetic risk of developing a disease. PRS might
              have a major impact on public health, possibly allowing for
              screening campaigns to identify high-genetic risk individuals for
              a given disease. The ``Clumping+Thresholding'' (C+T) approach is
              the most common method to derive PRS. C+T uses only univariate
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, which
              makes it fast and easy to use. However, previous work showed that
              jointly estimating SNP effects for computing PRS has the
              potential to significantly improve the predictive performance of
              PRS as compared to C+T. In this paper, we present an efficient
              method for the joint estimation of SNP effects using
              individual-level data, allowing for practical application of
              penalized logistic regression (PLR) on modern datasets including
              hundreds of thousands of individuals. Moreover, our
              implementation of PLR directly includes automatic choices for
              hyper-parameters. We also provide an implementation of penalized
              linear regression for quantitative traits. We compare the
              performance of PLR, C+T and a derivation of random forests using
              both real and simulated data. Overall, we find that PLR achieves
              equal or higher predictive performance than C+T in most scenarios
              considered, while being scalable to biobank data. In particular,
              we find that improvement in predictive performance is more
              pronounced when there are few effects located in nearby genomic
              regions with correlated SNPs; for instance, in simulations, AUC
              values increase from 83\% with the best prediction of C+T to
              92.5\% with PLR. We confirm these results in a data analysis of a
              case-control study for celiac disease where PLR and the standard
              C+T method achieve AUC values of 89\% and of 82.5\%. Applying
              penalized linear regression to 350,000 individuals of the UK
              Biobank, we predict height with a larger correlation than with
              the best prediction of C+T (∼65\% instead of ∼55\%), further
              demonstrating its scalability and strong predictive power, even
              for highly polygenic traits. Moreover, using 150,000 individuals
              of the UK Biobank, we are able to predict breast cancer better
              than C+T, fitting PLR in a few minutes only. In conclusion, this
              paper demonstrates the feasibility and relevance of using
              penalized regression for PRS computation when large
              individual-level datasets are available, thanks to the efficient
              implementation available in our R package bigstatsr.",

              architecture across traits, are still unanswered. The current
              availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity
              to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155
              publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on
              558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and
              genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover
              more than half of the genome, and 90\% of these overlap with loci
              from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are
              enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory
              elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability

              explained 17-29\% of the variance in liability. The genetic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most studies underline the contribution of heritable
              factors for psychiatric disorders. However, heritability
              estimates depend on the population under study, diagnostic
              instruments, and study designs that each has its inherent
              assumptions, strengths, and biases. We aim to test the
              homogeneity in heritability estimates between two powerful, and
              state of the art study designs for eight psychiatric disorders.
              METHODS: We assessed heritability based on data of Swedish
              siblings (N = 4 408 646 full and maternal half-siblings), and
              based on summary data of eight samples with measured genotypes (N
              = 125 533 cases and 208 215 controls). All data were based on
              standard diagnostic criteria. Eight psychiatric disorders were
              studied: (1) alcohol dependence (AD), (2) anorexia nervosa, (3)
              attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), (4) autism
              spectrum disorder, (5) bipolar disorder, (6) major depressive
              disorder, (7) obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and (8)
              schizophrenia. RESULTS: Heritability estimates from sibling data
              varied from 0.30 for Major Depression to 0.80 for ADHD. The
              estimates based on the measured genotypes were lower, ranging
              from 0.10 for AD to 0.28 for OCD, but were significant, and
              correlated positively (0.19) with national sibling-based
              estimates. When removing OCD from the data the correlation
              increased to 0.50. CONCLUSIONS: Given the unique character of
              each study design, the convergent findings for these eight
              psychiatric conditions suggest that heritability estimates are
              robust across different methods. The findings also highlight
              large differences in genetic and environmental influences between
              psychiatric disorders, providing future directions for
              etiological psychiatric research.",

  abstract = "Schizophrenia is an idiopathic mental disorder with a heritable
              component and a substantial public health impact. We conducted a
              multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
              schizophrenia beginning with a Swedish national sample (5,001
              cases and 6,243 controls) followed by meta-analysis with previous
              schizophrenia GWAS (8,832 cases and 12,067 controls) and finally
              by replication of SNPs in 168 genomic regions in independent
              samples (7,413 cases, 19,762 controls and 581 parent-offspring
              trios). We identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide
              significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously
              implicated in bipolar disorder. Examination of candidate genes at
              these loci suggests the involvement of neuronal calcium
              signaling. We estimate that 8,300 independent, mostly common SNPs
              (95\% credible interval of 6,300-10,200 SNPs) contribute to risk
              for schizophrenia and that these collectively account for at
              least 32\% of the variance in liability. Common genetic variation
              has an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and
              larger studies will allow more detailed understanding of this
              disorder.",

              cases and 31,358 controls of European descent, with follow-up
              analysis of 822 variants with P < 1 $\times$ 10-4 in an
              additional 9,412 cases and 137,760 controls. Eight of the 19
              variants that were genome-wide significant (P < 5 $\times$ 10-8)

              combined analysis, consistent with small effect sizes and limited
              power but also with genetic heterogeneity. In the combined
              analysis, 30 loci were genome-wide significant, including 20
              newly identified loci. The significant loci contain genes
              encoding ion channels, neurotransmitter transporters and synaptic

              heritability spread across thousands of loci. One possible
              explanation is that thousands of genes and loci have similarly
              important biological effects when mutated. However, we
              hypothesize that for most complex traits, relatively few genes
              and loci are critical, and negative selection-purging
              large-effect mutations in these regions-leaves behind
              common-variant associations in thousands of less critical regions
              instead. We refer to this phenomenon as flattening. To quantify
              its effects, we introduce a mathematical definition of
              polygenicity, the effective number of independently associated
              SNPs (Me), which describes how evenly the heritability of a trait
              is spread across the genome. We developed a method, stratified LD
              fourth moments regression (S-LD4M), to estimate Me, validating
              that it produces robust estimates in simulations. Analyzing 33
              complex traits (average N = 361k), we determined that
              heritability is spread ∼4$\times$ more evenly among common SNPs
              than among low-frequency SNPs. This difference, together with
              evolutionary modeling of new mutations, suggests that complex
              traits would be orders of magnitude less polygenic if not for the
              influence of negative selection. We also determined that
              heritability is spread more evenly within functionally important
              regions in proportion to their heritability enrichment;
              functionally important regions do not harbor common SNPs with
              greatly increased causal effect sizes, due to selective
              constraint. Our results suggest that for most complex traits, the

              differ from those with the strongest common-variant associations.",

              Polymorphism markers. The ability of such ``genetic profiles'' to
              predict outcome is usually quantified in an independent data set.
              Coefficients of determination (R(2) ) have been a useful measure
              to quantify the goodness-of-fit of the genetic profile. Various
              pseudo-R(2) measures for binary responses have been proposed.
              However, there is no standard or consensus measure because the
              concept of residual variance is not easily defined on the
              observed probability scale. Unlike other nongenetic predictors
              such as environmental exposure, there is prior information on
              genetic predictors because for most traits there are estimates of
              the proportion of variation in risk in the population due to all
              genetic factors, the heritability. It is this useful ability to
              benchmark that makes the choice of a measure of goodness-of-fit

              studies that are typical in human disease studies, we can obtain

              widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex
              traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of
              familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well
              as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family
              structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely
              investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of
              population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for
              relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele
              frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong
              assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption
              is often untenable. RESULTS: Here, we present a rapid algorithm
              for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data
              typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population
              substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be
              precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship
              coefficient, independent of sample composition or population
              structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments
              to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide
              reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands
              of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application
              of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates
              that it performs properly even under extreme population
              stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous

              by using an efficient penalized regression. We apply SCT to eight
              different case-control diseases in the UK biobank data and find
              that SCT substantially improves prediction accuracy with an
              average AUC increase of 0.035 over standard C+T.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of genetic data is
              routinely used to infer ancestry and control for population
              structure in various genetic analyses. However, conducting PCA
              analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls.
              These pitfalls include (1) capturing Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
              structure instead of population structure, (2) projected PCs that
              suffer from shrinkage bias, (3) detecting sample outliers, and
              (4) uneven population sizes. In this work, we explore these
              potential issues when using PCA, and present efficient solutions
              to these. Following applications to the UK Biobank and the 1000
              Genomes project datasets, we make recommendations for best
              practices and provide efficient and user-friendly implementations
              of the proposed solutions in R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr.
              RESULTS: for example, we find that PC19 to PC40 in the UK Biobank
              capture complex LD structure rather than population structure.
              Using our automatic algorithm for removing long-range LD regions,
              we recover 16 PCs that capture population structure only.
              Therefore, we recommend using only 16-18 PCs from the UK Biobank
              to account for population structure confounding. We also show how
              to use PCA to restrict analyses to individuals of homogeneous
              ancestry. Finally, when projecting individual genotypes onto the
              PCA computed from the 1000 Genomes project data, we find a
              shrinkage bias that becomes large for PC5 and beyond. We then
              demonstrate how to obtain unbiased projections efficiently using
              bigsnpr. CONCLUSION: Overall, we believe this work would be of
              interest for anyone using PCA in their analyses of genetic data,

  abstract = "SUMMARY: A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a sum of
              trait-associated alleles across many genetic loci, typically
              weighted by effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association
              study. The application of PRS has grown in recent years as their
              utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits has
              become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the
              presence of a genetic signal in underpowered studies, to infer
              the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical
              trials, and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we
              present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice ('precise'), for
              calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of
              PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a large number of thresholds
              (``high resolution'') to provide the best-fit PRS, as well as
              provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, can thin
              Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according to linkage
              disequilibrium and P-value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and
              imputed data, can calculate and incorporate ancestry-informative
              variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a single
              run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on
              schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and smoking, illustrate
              the importance of identifying the best-fit PRS and estimate a
              P-value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS studies.

              group participants into different risk categories for diseases,
              and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A
              number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed,
              and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate
              information available in published summary statistics. As there
              is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in

              information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To

              and potentially develop diagnostic models for disease. However,
              many current datasets cannot be analysed with standard tools due
              to their large size. RESULTS: We introduce SparSNP, a tool for
              fitting lasso linear models for massive SNP datasets quickly and
              with very low memory requirements. In analysis on a large celiac

              substantially faster than four other state-of-the-art tools for
              fitting large scale penalised models. SparSNP was one of only two
              tools that could successfully fit models to the entire celiac

              (GEBV) from information from larger breeds. However, this
              requires that marker-quantitative trait loci associations persist
              across breeds. Here, we assessed the gain in accuracy of GEBV in
              Jersey cattle as a result of using a combined Holstein and Jersey
              reference population, with either 39,745 or 624,213 single
              nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The surrogate used for
              accuracy was the correlation of GEBV with daughter trait
              deviations in a validation population. Two methods were used to
              predict breeding values, either a genomic BLUP (GBLUP\_mod), or a
              new method, BayesR, which used a mixture of normal distributions
              as the prior for SNP effects, including one distribution that set
              SNP effects to zero. The GBLUP\_mod method scaled both the
              genomic relationship matrix and the additive relationship matrix
              to a base at the time the breeds diverged, and regressed the
              genomic relationship matrix to account for sampling errors in
              estimating relationship coefficients due to a finite number of
              markers, before combining the 2 matrices. Although these
              modifications did result in less biased breeding values for
              Jerseys compared with an unmodified genomic relationship matrix,
              BayesR gave the highest accuracies of GEBV for the 3 traits
              investigated (milk yield, fat yield, and protein yield), with an
              average increase in accuracy compared with GBLUP\_mod across the
              3 traits of 0.05 for both Jerseys and Holsteins. The advantage
              was limited for either Jerseys or Holsteins in using 624,213 SNP
              rather than 39,745 SNP (0.01 for Holsteins and 0.03 for Jerseys,
              averaged across traits). Even this limited and nonsignificant
              advantage was only observed when BayesR was used. An alternative
              panel, which extracted the SNP in the transcribed part of the
              bovine genome from the 624,213 SNP panel (to give 58,532 SNP),
              performed better, with an increase in accuracy of 0.03 for
              Jerseys across traits. This panel captures much of the increased
              genomic content of the 624,213 SNP panel, with the advantage of a
              greatly reduced number of SNP effects to estimate. Taken
              together, using this panel, a combined breed reference and using
              BayesR rather than GBLUP\_mod increased the accuracy of GEBV in
              Jerseys from 0.43 to 0.52, averaged across the 3 traits.",

  abstract = "Both linear mixed models (LMMs) and sparse regression models are
              widely used in genetics applications, including, recently,
              polygenic modeling in genome-wide association studies. These two
              approaches make very different assumptions, so are expected to
              perform well in different situations. However, in practice, for a
              given dataset one typically does not know which assumptions will
              be more accurate. Motivated by this, we consider a hybrid of the
              two, which we refer to as a ``Bayesian sparse linear mixed
              model'' (BSLMM) that includes both these models as special cases.
              We address several key computational and statistical issues that
              arise when applying BSLMM, including appropriate prior
              specification for the hyper-parameters and a novel Markov chain
              Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. We apply BSLMM and
              compare it with other methods for two polygenic modeling
              applications: estimating the proportion of variance in phenotypes
              explained (PVE) by available genotypes, and phenotype (or
              breeding value) prediction. For PVE estimation, we demonstrate
              that BSLMM combines the advantages of both standard LMMs and
              sparse regression modeling. For phenotype prediction it
              considerably outperforms either of the other two methods, as well
              as several other large-scale regression methods previously
              suggested for this problem. Software implementing our method is

  abstract = "BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) is widely used to predict
              complex traits in plant and animal breeding, and increasingly in
              human genetics. The BLUP mathematical model, which consists of a
              single random effect term, was adequate when kinships were
              measured from pedigrees. However, when genome-wide SNPs are used
              to measure kinships, the BLUP model implicitly assumes that all
              SNPs have the same effect-size distribution, which is a severe
              and unnecessary limitation. We propose MultiBLUP, which extends
              the BLUP model to include multiple random effects, allowing
              greatly improved prediction when the random effects correspond to
              classes of SNPs with distinct effect-size variances. The SNP
              classes can be specified in advance, for example, based on SNP
              functional annotations, and we also provide an adaptive procedure
              for determining a suitable partition of SNPs. We apply MultiBLUP

              biological insights for several complex traits. RICOPILI, an
              open-sourced Perl-based pipeline was developed to address the
              challenges of rapidly processing large-scale multi-cohort GWAS
              studies including quality control (QC), imputation and downstream
              analyses. The pipeline is computationally efficient with
              portability to a wide range of high-performance computing
              environments. RICOPILI was created as the Psychiatric Genomics
              Consortium pipeline for GWAS and adopted by other users. The
              pipeline features (i) technical and genomic QC in case-control
              and trio cohorts, (ii) genome-wide phasing and imputation, (iv)
              association analysis, (v) meta-analysis, (vi) polygenic risk
              scoring and (vii) replication analysis. Notably, a major
              differentiator from other GWAS pipelines, RICOPILI leverages on
              automated parallelization and cluster job management approaches
              for rapid production of imputed genome-wide data. A comprehensive
              meta-analysis of simulated GWAS data has been incorporated
              demonstrating each step of the pipeline. This includes all the
              associated visualization plots, to allow ease of data

              datasets are also packaged with the pipeline for user training
              tutorials and developer work. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
              RICOPILI has a flexible architecture to allow for ongoing
              development and incorporation of newer available algorithms and
              is adaptable to various HPC environments (QSUB, BSUB, SLURM and

              efficacy of tests in correctly classifying diseased and
              non-diseased individuals. We use quantitative genetics theory to
              provide insight into the genetic interpretation of the area under
              the ROC curve (AUC) when the test classifier is a predictor of
              genetic risk. Even when the proportion of genetic variance
              explained by the test is 100\%, there is a maximum value for AUC

              either the sibling recurrence risk or heritability and disease

              research. LDpred is a popular and powerful method for deriving
              polygenic scores based on summary statistics and a matrix of
              correlation between genetic variants. However, LDpred has
              limitations that may result in limited predictive performance.
              Here we present LDpred2, a new version of LDpred that addresses
              these issues. We also provide two new options in LDpred2: a
              ``sparse'' option that can learn effects that are exactly 0, and
              an ``auto'' option that directly learns parameters from data. We
              benchmark LDpred2 against the previous version on simulated and
              real data, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness
              and efficiency, as well as providing much more accurate polygenic
              scores. LDpred2 is implemented in R package bigsnpr. \#\#\#

  author   = "Bulik-Sullivan, Brendan",
  abstract = "Mixed models are an effective statistical method for increasing
              power and avoiding confounding in genetic association studies.
              Existing mixed model methods have been designed for ``pooled''
              studies where all individual-level genotype and phenotype data
              are simultaneously visible to a single analyst. Many studies
              follow a ``meta-analysis'' design, wherein a large number of
              independent cohorts share only summary statistics with a central
              meta-analysis group, and no one person can view individual-level
              data for more than a small fraction of the total sample. When
              using linear regression for GWAS, there is no difference in power
              between pooled studies and meta-analyses [[1][1]]; however, we
              show that when using mixed models, standard meta-analysis is much
              less powerful than mixed model association on a pooled study of
              equal size. We describe a method that allows meta-analyses to
              capture almost all of the power available to mixed model
              association on a pooled study without sharing individual-level
              genotype data. The added computational cost and analytical
              complexity of this method is minimal, but the increase in power
              can be large: based on the predictive performance of polygenic
              scoring reported in [[2][2]] and [[3][3]], we estimate that the
              next height and BMI studies could see increases in effective
              sample size of $\approx$15\% and $\approx$8\%, respectively.
              Last, we describe how a related technique can be used to increase
              power in sequencing, targeted sequencing and exome array studies.
              Note that these techniques are presently only applicable to
              randomly ascertained studies and will sometimes result in loss of
              power in ascertained case/control studies. We are developing
              similar methods for case/control studies, but this is more
              complicated. [1]: \#ref-1 [2]: \#ref-2 [3]: \#ref-3",

              psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here
              we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative
              (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the
              Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a
              genome-wide association study of 16,992 cases of anorexia nervosa
              and 55,525 controls, identifying eight significant loci. The
              genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical
              presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with
              psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic
              (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits,
              independent of the effects of common variants associated with
              body-mass index. These results further encourage a
              reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric
              disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical
              direction for future research, and paying attention to both
              psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving
              outcomes.",

  abstract = "Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in
              susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly
              non-coding variants. However, much of the genetic contribution to
              breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the results of
              a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases
              and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and
              13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci
              that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at P < 5
              $\times$ 10-8. The majority of credible risk single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements,
              and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in
              breast cells at each locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap
              between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast
              tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to
              all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was
              2-5-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with
              strong enrichment for particular transcription factor binding
              sites. These results provide further insight into genetic
              susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of
              genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention.",

              study (GWAS) analysis of common SNPs. Leveraging phased
              haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS
              meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating

              million low-frequency (0.005 < MAF < 0.05) variants. In addition
              to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten

              no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a

              associated with clinical features of major depression and
              implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in
              cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved
              in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We
              found important relationships of genetic risk for major
              depression with educational attainment, body mass, and
              schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass
              were putatively causal, whereas major depression and
              schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All
              humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors
              for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of
              major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk
              underlies the clinical phenotype.",

              697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained
              one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing
              different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show
              that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs
              explained ∼21\%, ∼24\% and ∼29\% of phenotypic variance.
              Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60\% of
              heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were
              enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be
              involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not

  abstract = "Much of the genetic basis of complex traits is present on current
              genotyping products, but the individual variants that affect the
              traits have largely not been identified. Several traditional
              problems in genetic epidemiology have recently been addressed by
              assuming a polygenic basis for disease and treating it as a
              single entity. Here I briefly review some of these applications,
              which collectively may be termed polygenic epidemiology.
              Methodologies in this area include polygenic scoring, linear
              mixed models, and linkage disequilibrium scoring. They have been
              used to establish a polygenic effect, estimate genetic
              correlation between traits, estimate how many variants affect a
              trait, stratify cases into subphenotypes, predict individual
              disease risks, and infer causal effects using Mendelian
              randomization. Polygenic epidemiology will continue to yield
              useful applications even while much of the specific variation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for an
              important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and
              adult onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly
              associated specific DNA variants has proved challenging. In the
              pregenomics era the genetic architecture (number, frequency and
              effect size of risk variants) of complex genetic disorders was
              unknown. Empirical evidence for the genetic architecture of
              psychiatric disorders is emerging from the genetic studies of the
              last 5 years. METHODS AND SCOPE: We review the methods
              investigating the polygenic nature of complex disorders. We
              provide mini-guides to genomic profile (or polygenic) risk
              scoring and to estimation of variance (or heritability) from
              common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also provided. We review
              results of applications of the methods to psychiatric disorders
              and related traits and consider how these methods inform on
              missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing
              heritability. FINDINGS: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing
              studies are providing evidence that psychiatric disorders are
              truly polygenic, that is they have a genetic architecture of many
              genetic variants, including risk variants that are both common
              and rare in the population. Sample sizes published to date are
              mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the magnitude
              presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained by
              the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs.
              CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the sample size for genome wide
              association studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the
              identification of more associated genetic variants, as already
              found for schizophrenia. These loci provide the starting point of
              functional analyses that might eventually lead to new prevention
              and treatment options and to improved biological validity of
              diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will contribute further
              to our understanding of complex genetic traits as sample sizes
              increase and as sample resources become richer in phenotypic
              descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of nongenetic
              risk factors.",

  abstract = "The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
              (AUC) is commonly used for assessing the discriminative ability
              of prediction models even though the measure is criticized for
              being clinically irrelevant and lacking an intuitive
              interpretation. Every tutorial explains how the coordinates of
              the ROC curve are obtained from the risk distributions of
              diseased and non-diseased individuals, but it has not become
              common sense that therewith the ROC plot is just another way of
              presenting these risk distributions. We show how the ROC curve is
              an alternative way to present risk distributions of diseased and
              non-diseased individuals and how the shape of the ROC curve
              informs about the overlap of the risk distributions. For example,
              ROC curves are rounded when the prediction model included
              variables with similar effect on disease risk and have an angle
              when, for example, one binary risk factor has a stronger effect;
              and ROC curves are stepped rather than smooth when the sample
              size or incidence is low, when the prediction model is based on a
              relatively small set of categorical predictors. This alternative
              perspective on the ROC plot invalidates most purported
              limitations of the AUC and attributes others to the underlying
              risk distributions. AUC is a measure of the discriminative
              ability of prediction models. The assessment of prediction models
              should be supplemented with other metrics to assess their

  abstract = "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have become the standard for
              quantifying genetic liability in the prediction of disease risks.
              PRSs are generally constructed as weighted sum scores of risk
              alleles using effect sizes from genome-wide association studies
              as their weights. The construction of PRSs is being improved with
              more appropriate selection of independent single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) and optimized estimation of their weights
              but is rarely reflected upon from a theoretical perspective,
              focusing on the validity of the risk score. Borrowing from
              psychometrics, this paper discusses the validity of PRSs and
              introduces the three main types of validity that are considered
              in the evaluation of tests and measurements: construct, content,
              and criterion validity. This introduction is followed by a
              discussion of three topics that challenge the validity of PRS,
              namely, their claimed independence of clinical risk factors, the
              consequences of relaxing SNP inclusion thresholds and the
              selection of SNP weights. This discussion of the validity of PRS
              reminds us that we need to keep questioning if weighted sums of
              risk alleles are measuring what we think they are in the various

              we introduce a new model-based enrichment method that requires
              only GWAS summary statistics. Applying this method to interrogate
              4,026 gene sets in 31 human phenotypes identifies many

              understanding of the genetic basis of a trait should allow for
              predictive methods with accuracies approaching the trait's
              heritability. The highly polygenic nature of quantitative traits
              and most common phenotypes has motivated the development of
              statistical strategies focused on combining myriad individually
              non-significant genetic effects. Now that predictive accuracies
              are improving, there is a growing interest in the practical
              utility of such methods for predicting risk of common diseases
              responsive to early therapeutic intervention. However, existing
              methods require individual-level genotypes or depend on
              accurately specifying the genetic architecture underlying each
              disease to be predicted. Here, we propose a polygenic risk
              prediction method that does not require explicitly modeling any
              underlying genetic architecture. We start with summary statistics
              in the form of SNP effect sizes from a large GWAS cohort. We then

              (NPS) method can reliably allow for linkage disequilibrium in
              summary statistics of 5 million dense genome-wide markers and
              consistently improves prediction accuracy. We show that NPS
              improves the identification of groups at high risk for breast
              cancer, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and coronary
              heart disease, all of which have available early intervention or

              architectures and scalable to biobank scale datasets with
              millions of individuals and tens of millions of genetic variants.
              Here, we develop such a method called Deterministic Bayesian
              Sparse Linear Mixed Model (DBSLMM). DBSLMM relies on a flexible
              modeling assumption on the effect size distribution to achieve
              robust and accurate prediction performance across a range of
              genetic architectures. DBSLMM also relies on a simple
              deterministic search algorithm to yield an approximate analytic
              estimation solution using summary statistics only. The
              deterministic search algorithm, when paired with further
              algebraic innovations, results in substantial computational
              savings. With simulations, we show that DBSLMM achieves scalable
              and accurate prediction performance across a range of realistic
              genetic architectures. We then apply DBSLMM to analyze 25 traits
              in UK Biobank. For these traits, compared to existing approaches,
              DBSLMM achieves an average of 2.03\%-101.09\% accuracy gain in
              internal cross-validations. In external validations on two
              separate datasets, including one from BioBank Japan, DBSLMM
              achieves an average of 14.74\%-522.74\% accuracy gain. In these
              real data applications, DBSLMM is 1.03-28.11 times faster and
              uses only 7.4\%-24.8\% of physical memory as compared to other
              multiple regression-based PGS methods. Overall, DBSLMM represents

              individual-specific genetic propensities and predict outcomes.
              This is typically achieved using a single polygenic score, but
              here we use a multi-polygenic score (MPS) approach to increase
              predictive power by exploiting the joint power of multiple
              discovery GWASs, without assumptions about the relationships
              among predictors. We used summary statistics of 81 well-powered
              GWASs of cognitive, medical and anthropometric traits to predict
              three core developmental outcomes in our independent target
              sample: educational achievement, body mass index (BMI) and
              general cognitive ability. We used regularized regression with
              repeated cross-validation to select from and estimate
              contributions of 81 polygenic scores in a UK representative
              sample of 6710 unrelated adolescents. The MPS approach predicted
              10.9\% variance in educational achievement, 4.8\% in general

              single-score predictions. As other relevant GWA analyses are
              reported, they can be incorporated in MPS models to maximize
              phenotype prediction. The MPS approach should be useful in

  abstract = "In human populations, assortative mating is almost univer­sally
              positive, with similarities between partners for quantit­ative
              phenotypes1--6, common disease risk1,3,7--10, beha­vi­our6,11,
              social factors12--14 and personality4,5,11. The causes and
              genetic consequences of assortative mating remain un­re­solved
              because partner similarity can arise from different mechanisms:
              phenotypic assortment based on mate choice15,16, partner
              interaction and convergence in phenotype over time14,17, or
              social homogamy where individuals pair according to social or
              environmental background. Here, we present theory and an
              analytical approach to test for genetic evidence of assortative
              mating and find a correlation in genetic value among partners for
              a range of phenotypes. Across three independent samples of 24,662
              spousal pairs in total, we infer a correlation at
              trait-associated loci between partners for height (0.200, 0.004
              standard error, SE) that matched the phenotypic correlation
              (0.201, 0.004 SE), and a correlation at trait-associated loci for
              BMI (0.143, 0.007 SE) that was significantly lower than the
              phenotypic value (0.228, 0.004 SE). We extend our analysis to the
              UK Biobank study (7,780 pairs), finding evidence of a correlation
              at trait-associated loci for waist-to-hip ratio (0.101, 0.041
              SE), systolic blood pressure (0.138, 0.064 SE) and educational
              attainment (0.654, 0.014 SE). Our results imply that mate choice,
              combined with widespread pleiotropy among traits, affects the
              genomic architecture of traits in humans.",

                 of risk alleles identified in genome-wide association studies
                 (GWASs). PGS methods differ in terms of which DNA variants are
                 included in the score and the weights assigned to them. PGSs
                 are evaluated in independent target samples of individuals
                 with known disease status. Evaluation of new PGS methods are
                 made using simulated data or single target cohort, however, in
                 real data sets there can be heterogeneity between target
                 sample cohorts, which could reflect a number of real or
                 artefactual factors. The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
                 working groups for schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive
                 disorder (MDD) bring together many independently collected
                 case-control cohorts for GWAS meta-analysis. These resources

                 characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.733, and explained 9.9\% of
                 variance on the liability scale. For MDD across 26 target
                 cohorts, the AUC and variance explained were 0.601 and 4.0\%,
                 respectively. The variance explained by the SBayesR PGS was
                 46\% and 43\% higher for SCZ and MDD, respectively, compared

  abstract = "Background The predictive utility of polygenic scores is
              increasing, and many polygenic scoring methods are available, but
              it is unclear which method performs best. This study evaluates
              the predictive utility of polygenic scoring methods within a
              reference-standardized framework, which uses a common set of
              variants and reference-based estimates of linkage disequilibrium
              and allele frequencies to construct scores. Methods Six polygenic
              score methods were tested: p-value thresholding and clumping
              (pT+clump), SBLUP, lassosum, LDPred, PRScs and SBayesR,
              evaluating their performance to predict outcomes in UK Biobank
              and the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). Strategies to
              identify optimal p-value threshold and shrinkage parameters were
              compared, including 10-fold cross validation, pseudovalidation
              (with no validation sample), and multi-polygenic score elastic
              net models. Results lassosum, PRScs and LDPred performed strongly
              using 10-fold cross-validation to identify the most predictive
              p-value threshold or shrinkage parameter, giving a relative
              improvement of 14-17\% over pT+clump in the correlation between
              observed and predicted outcome values. Using pseudovalidation,
              the best method was PRScs, with a relative improvement of >11\%
              over other pseudovalidation methods (lassosum, SBLUP, SBayesR,
              LDPred), and only 1\% less than the best polygenic score
              identified by 10-fold cross validation. Elastic net models
              containing polygenic scores based on a range of parameters
              consistently improved prediction over any single polygenic score.
              Conclusion Within a reference-standardized framework, the best
              polygenic prediction was achieved using lassosum and PRScs,
              modeling multiple polygenic scores derived using multiple
              parameters. This study will help researchers performing polygenic
              score studies to select the most powerful and predictive analysis

              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small
              fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly
              software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA),
              which was developed based on a method we recently developed to
              address the ``missing heritability'' problem. GCTA estimates the
              variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the
              whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the
              association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce
              GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the
              genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of
              variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage
              disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the
              function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on
              the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage
              compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate
              and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.",

              social factors12--14 and personality4,5,11. The causes and
              genetic consequences of assortative mating remain un­re­solved
              because partner similarity can arise from different mechanisms:
              phenotypic assortment based on mate choice15,16, partner
              interaction and convergence in phenotype over time14,17, or
              social homogamy where individuals pair according to social or
              environmental background. Here, we present theory and an
              analytical approach to test for genetic evidence of assortative
              mating and find a correlation in genetic value among partners for
              a range of phenotypes. Across three independent samples of 24,662
              spousal pairs in total, we infer a correlation at
              trait-associated loci between partners for height (0.200, 0.004
              standard error, SE) that matched the phenotypic correlation
              (0.201, 0.004 SE), and a correlation at trait-associated loci for
              BMI (0.143, 0.007 SE) that was significantly lower than the
              phenotypic value (0.228, 0.004 SE). We extend our analysis to the
              UK Biobank study (7,780 pairs), finding evidence of a correlation
              at trait-associated loci for waist-to-hip ratio (0.101, 0.041

              attainment (0.654, 0.014 SE). Our results imply that mate choice,

                 global populations is a major concern that must be addressed
                 before PGS can be used for everyone in the clinic. Indeed,
                 prediction accuracy has been shown to decay as a function of
                 the genetic distance between the training and test cohorts.
                 However, such cohorts differ not only in their genetic
                 distance but also in their geographical distance and their
                 data collection and assaying, conflating multiple factors. In
                 this study, we examine the extent to which PGS are
                 transferable between ancestries by deriving polygenic scores
                 for 245 curated traits from the UK Biobank data and applying
                 them in nine ancestry groups from the same cohort. By
                 restricting both training and testing to the UK Biobank data,
                 we reduce the risk of environmental and genotyping confounding
                 from using different cohorts. We define the nine ancestry
                 groups at a high-resolution, country-specific level, based on
                 a simple, robust and effective method that we introduce here.
                 We then apply two different predictive methods to derive
                 polygenic scores for all 245 phenotypes, and show a systematic
                 and dramatic reduction in portability of PGS trained in the
                 inferred ancestral UK population and applied to the inferred
                 ancestral Polish - Italian - Iranian - Indian - Chinese -
                 Caribbean - Nigerian - Ashkenazi populations, respectively.
                 These analyses, performed at a finer scale than the usual
                 continental scale, demonstrate that prediction already drops
                 off within European ancestries and reduces globally in
                 proportion to PC distance, even when all individuals reside in
                 the same country and are genotyped and phenotyped as part of
                 the same cohort. Our study provides high-resolution and robust

  abstract = "Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of height and body
              mass index (BMI) in ∼250000 European participants have led to the
              discovery of ∼700 and ∼100 nearly independent single nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these traits, respectively.
              Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with
              GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank
              participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS
              meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially
              increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these
              traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs
              associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised
              genome-wide significance threshold of P < 1 $\times$ 10-8),
              including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs
              located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS.
              The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6\%
              of the variance of height and ∼6.0\% of the variance of BMI in an
              independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
              Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with
              actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22,
              respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based
              Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs
              among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138
              genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously
              predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by
              the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and
              providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex

  author   = "Daetwyler, Hans D and Villanueva, Beatriz and Woolliams, John A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prediction of the genetic disease risk of an
              individual is a powerful public health tool. While predicting
              risk has been successful in diseases which follow simple
              Mendelian inheritance, it has proven challenging in complex
              diseases for which a large number of loci contribute to the
              genetic variance. The large numbers of single nucleotide
              polymorphisms now available provide new opportunities for
              predicting genetic risk of complex diseases with high accuracy.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have derived simple
              deterministic formulae to predict the accuracy of predicted
              genetic risk from population or case control studies using a
              genome-wide approach and assuming a dichotomous disease phenotype
              with an underlying continuous liability. We show that the
              prediction equations are special cases of the more general
              problem of predicting the accuracy of estimates of genetic values
              of a continuous phenotype. Our predictive equations are
              responsive to all parameters that affect accuracy and they are
              independent of allele frequency and effect distributions.
              Deterministic prediction errors when tested by simulation were
              generally small. The common link among the expressions for
              accuracy is that they are best summarized as the product of the
              ratio of number of phenotypic records per number of risk loci and
              the observed heritability. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study
              advances the understanding of the relative power of case control
              and population studies of disease. The predictions represent an
              upper bound of accuracy which may be achievable with improved
              effect estimation methods. The formulae derived will help
              researchers determine an appropriate sample size to attain a
              certain accuracy when predicting genetic risk.",

              and the first genome-wide significant locus has been identified.
              We describe methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa
              Genetics Initiative (ANGI), an international collaboration
              designed to rapidly recruit 13,000 individuals with AN and
              ancestrally matched controls. We present sample characteristics
              and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic
              questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population
              research. METHODS: ANGI recruited from the United States (US),
              Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK).
              Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment
              centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US,
              ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV
              or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had
              no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the
              positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating
              disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the
              Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H.
              RESULTS: Blood samples and clinical information were collected
              from 13,363 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls.
              Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the
              validity of the questionnaire was acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid
              recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other
              groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the
              Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in
